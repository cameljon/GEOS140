# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical Geography

## Learning Objectives:

- What is physical geography?

    > Physical geography involves the spatial analysis of the various physical components and natural processes of the Earth.

- What is systems theory and how does it apply to Earth?

    > Analyze or describe a group of variables that work together to produce some definable result. Explains how one Earth process inputs/outputs effect another Earth process. 

- Describe the model of Earth involving the four spheres (abiotic and biotic).

    > Atmosphere - gaseous shell surrounding the Earth.
    > Lithosphere - outer solid layer of Earth comprised of the soil and minerals. (aprox: 44 mi)
    > Hydrosphere - part of Earth where water in all it's forms is stored
    > Biosphere - the living portion of Earth (including humans)

- List the steps involved in using the Scientific Method and understand the significance of the word theory.

    > Recognition of a problem
    > Formulation of hypotheses
    > Testing of hypotheses through the collection of data by: measurement, observation, experiment.

## Notes:

- Using this photo from one of my favorite places, Deep Lake in the Wind River Range, how would you define physical geography? What are the 4 spheres involved?

    > Atmosphere
    > Lithosphere
    > Hydrosphere
    > Biosphere

- Do these spheres interact? If they do, now we are talking about processes. This cylindrical hole in igneous rock is about 2 ft across and 13 ft deep. It is found on a bedrock terrace about 50 ft higher than the St. Croix River in Wisconsin. There are many of these potholes along this stretch of the river. Write a hypothesis to explain this feature.

    > The holes could be formed by moving water and or moving atmosphere.

- Rounded rocks like this basketball-sized example are sometimes found in the potholes. Does this change your original hypothesis? Is it supporting evidence?

    > Spatial – what are the characteristics of a place and how do those characteristics differ from another place
    > the potholes are found next to the modern river
    > the potholes are higher than the modern river
    > rounded rocks are sometimes found in the potholes

    > Temporal – processes even at one place change over time
    > the modern river is flowing at a lower elevation now
    > the modern river is not carrying basketball-sized rocks now 

- So what was the river’s flow like in the past contrasted to today?

    > There river could have changed flow or eroded enough soil/rock away to lower the current water levels.

- Here is another good example of spatial differences related to river volume across the US at a particular time. What do you think was happening along the Middle Atlantic and northeastern states?

    > One reason is there is higher amounts of rainfall in the eastern United States.
    > Here is another temporal example. Something forms in the Universe and we eventually observe the energy that was emitted. It might not look exactly like this now. New Horizons just passed Pluto as I write this. It took years to travel there and the imagery and other data collected is taking hours to be sent back to NASA. And there is so much data, it will take about a year to get it all!

- Do processes change through time? From 1860 to 2000, what has happened to global air temperature? This is an example of dynamic equilibrium. What would a graph representing steady-state equilibrium look like? 

- We’ve been making observations about places and processes over time. If you have taken a face-to-face class at JCCC, you’ve probably griped about parking. We want to apply the scientific method to the problem.

    > Observation – I can’t find a parking spot!
    > Hypothesis – an attempt to explain observation(s)
    > So what is your hypothesis about this situation at JCCC? Maybe it is there isn’t enough parking at JCCC. So what is the next step?
    > Testing your hypothesis!

Guess what? It has been done!

Is the hypothesis (there isn’t enough parking at JCCC) correct? No? Then we go back to our observations and come up with a different hypothesis; maybe one involving the lack of spaces close enough to the building that you want! What would these graphs have to show in order for the testing to support the hypothesis and then become a theory? Do the graphs for the Southeast and Southwest parking lots represent dynamic equilibrium or steady-state equilibrium?
