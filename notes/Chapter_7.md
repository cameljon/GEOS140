# Chapter 7: Atmospheric Moisture and Precipitation
#### Instructor: Lynne Beatty
#### Spring 2018

## Learning Objectives:

* Sketch, label, and describe a diagram of the hydrologic cycle.

    > Hydrologic cycle is the movement of water from one reservoir to another by various processes

* What is hydrogen bonding?

    > Attraction between the water molecules is called hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen atems form good bonds between atoms.

* Explain the physical states of water.

    > solid state - ice
    > liquid state - water
    > gaseous state - water vapor

* What is latent heat?

    > hidden energy stored in molecular bonds

* What is relative humidity and how is it related to temperature?

    > Relative humidity is the ratio of specific to maximum humidity of a body of air
    > Warmer air can hold much more water vapor than colder air

* What is the dew-point temperature?

    > Dew-point temperature is the temperature at which condensation occurs. The relative humidity is 100% at this point and the air cannot hold any more water vapor.

* What is an adiabatic change?

    > Temperature changes that are solely from the expansion and compression of air due to pressure flucuations

* Describe the characteristics of the stratus, cumulus, and cirrus cloud classes.

    > Stratus clouds - layered sheets of clouds that have a thick and dark appearance.
    > Cumulus clouds - puffy clouds that develop due to convection. Flat horizontal base.
    > Cirrus clouds - Thin, wispy clouds that develop high in the troposphere. Contain ice crystals instead of water droplets.

* Compare and contrast advection fog, evaporation fog, upslope and valley fog, and radiation fog.

    > Radiation fog - develops at night when a temperature inversion exists
    > Advection fog - develops when warm air flows over cooler air
    > Evaporation fog -
    > Upslope and valley fog -

* How do raindrops form?

    > At high altitudes ice crystals form and absorb other water droplets
    > Or small water droplets merge into larger rain drops

* Distinguish between convergent lifting, convectional lifting, orographic lifting and frontal lifting. Where and why does each type of lifting tend to develop?

    > Convergent uplift occurs when bodies of air meet at a central location, forcing air upwards
    > Convectional uplift occurs when warmer air rises
    > Orographic uplift happens when air rises up a mountain
    > Frontal uplift happens when warm air rises as it meets a cold air mass

* Compare and contrast a stable air mass with an unstable air mass.

    > Stable air refers to the low potential for convection
    > Unstable air has higher potential for convection and allows clouds to develop

* Describe the changes that take place in an ascending or descending air mass in unstable atmospheric conditions.

    > Warm air rises within a relatively cool surrounding air. The two bodies of air have different environmental lapse rates. As the air rises it will reach the level of condensation and start cooling at the wet adiabatic lapse rate. The temperature difference between the two bodies of air will cause condensation at the level of condensation and clouds will form. If futher cooling happens then rain will form.

* How do long-term patterns of atmospheric pressure relate to droughts?

    > Drought conditions in the region develop when strong high-pressure systems develop and persist, causing air to compress, temperatures to rise adiabatically, and relative humidity to fall.
