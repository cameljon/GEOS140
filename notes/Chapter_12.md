# Chapter 12: Earth's Internal Structure, Rock Cycle, and Geologic Time

## Learning Objectives

Describe the characteristics of the crust, mantle, and core.

Contrast the characteristics of the lithosphere with the asthenosphere.

What is an isostatic adjustment?

  * Over a very long period of time the elevation of the continent decreases due to erosion. The sediments are deposited at the continental margin. As a result the underlying asthenosphere begins to bounce back due to decreased weight put on it by the continental crust. Eventually the levels balance out.

Sketch and label the rock cycle. Distinguish between minerals and the three rock types.

  * Ingeous rock - when liquid magma cools
    * Largely consists of silicate minerals - silicon and oxygen atoms.
    * Extrusive - flows out of, or extrudes from, Earth
    * Intrusive - cools internally.. body of intrusive ingneous rock referred to as pluton
  * Sedimentary rock - rocks that form through deposition and lithification
    * Can be small fragments or dissolved substances from other rocks or marine animals
    * Lithification - overtime the sediments become cemented to one another
  * Metamorphic rock - forms when ingeous or sedimentary rock is subjected to intense heat or pressure.
    * Slate - heated and compressed shale
    * Marble - heated and compressed limestone
    * Gneiss - rock that came in close contact with intrusive magmas
      * Foliated - banding on the rocks
      * Non-foliated - no bands

Know the terms for igneous plutons and recognize the landforms.

  * Plutons form when intrusive ingeous rock cools internally
    * Batholiths - largest plutons
    * Stock - smaller rounded pluton attached to a batholith
    * Dike - magma moves upward into small fissures in overlying rock
    * Sill - moves up through a dike and spreads horizontally
    * Laccolith - like sill but pushes upwards to form a dome-like feature

Explain how radiometric time is determined.

  * Dating a substance based on it's radiative decay from one element into another

What is significant about the Anthropocene Epoch?

  * Addition of a new epoch to Earth's time-line. Recognizes humans as the foremost agent of change
