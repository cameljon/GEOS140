## Introduction

During the period between February 25th and February 28th, data was collected and compared to illustrate weather changes over the course of four days. Data collected included temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, cloud conditions, and precipitation.

<a id="methods"></a>
## Methods

Information was gathered though online resources and local observation at home in Overland Park. Additional observations were made at Johnson County Community College. The online resource used was https://www.wunderground.com. Observations were made to collect cloud conditions and directional wind information was compared to online data. Online data was preferred for accuracy. Personal graphs were generated using www.OnlineChartTool.com.

## Interpretations/Analysis

The week started out with calm, mild weather. The air was cool and dry with a low relative humidity and high pressure compared to the rest of the week. Temperatures warmed and pressure dropped over the next four days, along with increasing humidity. By Wednesday, the dew point temperature was near or equal to the air temperature producing 100% relative humidity.

The data shows the relationship between pressure and relative humidity is inversely proportional. Higher pressure air cannot hold as much water vapor as low pressure air. Over the next four days the pressure dropped sand therefor allowed increased capacity for water vapor. As the water vapor in the air increased, this also raised the dew point temperature, or temperature at which the air cannot hold any more water vapor. The data shows 100% humidity was reached on Wednesday morning.

On Sunday, the temperatures and humidity was low, and the pressure was high compared to the rest of the week. This indicates a cool, high pressure system with calm winds. As the pressure dropped we saw an increased in winds and mostly cloudy skies. This indicated a warmer, low pressure system moved in. The wind direction was from the south indicating the low pressure system came from the south, bringing with it warmer temperatures, moisture, and cloudy skies.
