How is a position described by latitude and longitude?

    Latitude are lines parallel to the equator around the earth.
    Longitude are vertical great circles with the origin being the Prime Meridian.

Locate the Equator, Tropics of Cancer/Capricorn, Arctic/Antarctic Circles, and the Poles.

    Equator is 0 deg latitude
    Tropic of Cancer 23.5 deg N
    Tropic of Capricorn 23.5 deg S
    Arctic Circle 66.5 deg N
    Antarctic Circle 66.5 deg S
    Poles are 90 deg N or S

Know the general locations of the low, mid, and high latitude geographic zones.
    
    Low latitudes - 35 deg N to 35 deg S - very warm region, consistent weather throughout the year
    mid latitudes - ~35 deg to ~55 deg in both N and S - seasonal weather, hot summer, cold winters
    High latitudes - 55 deg to 90 deg in both N and S - very cold region with short summers

What are the three types of map scale?  How do map scale and map projection affect what we see?

    Written scale - showing distance in relation to size on the map.
    Representative fraction - a ratio or fraction of actual size
    Graphic scale (Bar scale) - show actual sizes on the maps, useful if maps are copied and made
                                smaller or larger than original.

How are remote sensing, global positioning systems, and geographic information systems used in the study of physical geography?

    Remote sensing allows geographers to survey regions without physically being there.
    GPS allows for higher position accuracy, monitoring plate movements and navigation.
    GIS is used to manage spacial information about soils, wetlands, vegetation etc.
