What is the electromagnetic spectrum of energy?

List three characteristics each for these atmospheric gases: nitrogen,oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone.

How does ozone form in the stratosphere?  How does ozone break down in the stratosphere?

What particulate matter pollution, natural and/or anthropogenic, affects your life?

Sketch and describe the pathways of solar radiation from the Sun to the Earth.

What is albedo?

How do clouds afffect the amount of solar radiation received on Earth's surface?

How is heat energy transferred?

What is the Greenhouse Effect and why does it occur?

Understand the energy budget in terms of surpluses and deficits by latitude.o

The low latitudes
    have a net surplus of radiation due to a higher angle of incidence
At sunrise
    solar radiation is traveling through a greater thickness of the atmosphere and scatters the shorter visible wavelengths completely
Because the Earth's axis is tilted
    the polar regions receive more insolation than if the axis were upright
Ozone in the stratosphere
    filters some ultraviolet radiation
The Greenhouse Effect refers to
    the delaying/trapping of longwave radiation by the atmosphere
A hot air balloon rising is an example of
    convection
Laten heat
    moves from/with liquid water into water vapor with evaporation
Ozone depletion occurs in
    the stratosphere
TV and radio are examples of
    long wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum
The most common gas in Earths atmosphere is
    nitrogen
